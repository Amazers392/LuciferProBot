HOWTO = """
New to *Lucifer Robot*?
Here is all you should know!\n
Enable welcome security, soft or strong.
`/welcomemute strong`
Note: Permanent mutes a user until they press a button within `160seconds`, most bots will get stuck here and get auto-kicked before they can waste your time.
Soft restricts them to text only for 24hours after joining.\n
Protect accidental contact leakage
`/lock contact`\n
Stop letting users add bots (Ideally, disable the "add users" permission in group settings)
`/lock bots`\n
Private group? concerned of invite links?
`/disable invitelink`\n
Lock forwarding stuff into the group
`/disable forward`\n
Private group? Avoid users kicking themselves by mistake
`/disable kickme`\n
Users/Spammers flooding non stop? (Adjust the number to your needs)
`/setflood 7`\n
Don't want some Lucifer commands enabled in group?
`/listcmds` and then use `/disable <namehere>`
Note: if this conflicts with any other bot in group then use `/disable@Lucifer_Probot` to send that message only to `Lucifer`.\n
Want to auto warn users when they say specific stuff?
See warns > `/addwarn command help`\n
Don't like some words to be spoken in group? Blacklist them using
`/addblacklist word1`
`word2`
`"entire sentence here"`\n
Note: You can use `"quotes for"` if there is a sentence and not a word.\n
Don't want to explain to each newbie? setup rules using 
`/setrules`
 Rules here\n
 Don't want our awesome welcome message? Use a custom one using
`/setwelcome Hi`, welcome to my group 
Note: This command has more stuff you can use, see `/welcomehelp` first.\n
Have multiple groups to handle? Setup Federations
Read help for this, this has a bit of a learning curve.\n
Enable reporting so that your users can report troublemakers to admins.
`/reports on`
Note: Send in group to enable group reports and send in Lucifer's pm so that he will report any enabled group to your pm.\n
Want to track which of your admins did what? who banned who? who joined?
Setup a log channel, see help for instructions.\n\n
Lastly, most of these would apply to almost any Lucifer like bot, please do spread the word around for basic chat control and protect yourself from spammers/scammers and troublemakers.\n
Visit us at @LuciferSupport anytime in case of queries, suggestions or in need of help setting up Lucifer for your chat.\n
